Grace's dad and brothers left the rest of us at the motel to drop off the rental and pick up a few things in Phoenix. Stuck there for the day I took the time to order a 4G hotspot router from AT&T and arrange a good mobile plan for 3 phones with international calling. Managed to arrange for the hotspot to be picked up from a store in Phoenix, but the getting the sim cards for the phones seemed to require a residential address for them to be delivered to.
