Left the Budget Inn and took the trailer to wallmart. Sorted luggage inside container. Bought more supplies for the trip from the Dollar Tree.

Booked two rooms just in time at the Quality Inn in Payson; an hour or two later the Motel was fully booked. Relaxed in the pool for a bit. Realised I was a bit out of shape as I was puffing and panting after only 5 minutes treading water. 

Had my first Arby's, but wasn't too impressed by the sandwich they got me; a two inch mound of sliced roast beef between two buns. I shared half with Grace. The curly fries and the mocha milkshake were alright though.

Waited till dusk for the temperature to cool off a bit before taking a walk through the nearby forrested suburbs with Grace's siblings. Couldn't see any lawns in any gardens; apparently the climate was too hot for that.
