Went to get supplies in the morning from wallmart. Had my first Taco Bell (in the States). Grace had really hyped it up, and, well, I like Mexicalli Fresh better. However, we fed Grace, her brother, my son and I for $15 US. In the evening We took a short walk up the smaller ridge in the valley our camp is situated in.
