Next morning Grace and her Mom had bought up the complimentary continental breakfast bag. Just had a bunch of breakfast bars. I got a breakfast burrito of the heat and eat variety. Grace's brothers soon arrived in a chevrolet tahoe and a rental and headed towards Payson. 

On the way out we had to buy a few things and I got to experience my first Wallmart. I had always imagined the interior to be a bit like our Kmart in NZ, cheap but well presented, but it was more like our Warehouse with a Countdown tacked on. 

The landscape just outside of Phoenix lived up to my expectations with its barren mountains and saguaro cacti. Apparently a fire had burn through a lot of the srub recently with burnt out patches of grasses and cacti on the right side of the road and this continued as we drove through the hills. 

Had my first American-Kiwi english misunderstanding. I ordered a *half taco salad* for lunch from a Wendy's on the way. THe lady had no idea what I said so I repeated, a *haaelf taaeco salad*. Understood me then.

Started to head up through the hills towards Payson, the Cacti and barren hills gave way to scrubby hills with the odd pine tree. As we got closer to Payson the pines got more frequent and Payson itself was surrounded by pin forests.

After arriving at the Budget Inn in Payson we got to look at the trailer. Grace's brothers had bought it a few days ago. It was a Dutchmen Duck, old but in pretty good shape.

Picked up some food and essentials in Wallmart then went back to the motel and made chicken wraps for dinner.
