Checked out of quality inn. Day was really hot; heat exaustion was a real danger. Spent most of the day in an airconditioned church run by a family friend. At the end of the day took the trailer to Wallmark carpark and spent the night there since they allow trailers and RVs to stay for 12 hours. As soon as we arrived there was a heavy downpour that lasted for a couple of hours. It was the first time I'd seen it rain in Arizona.
