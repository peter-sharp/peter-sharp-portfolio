Arrived in Phoenix airport around 8:20 pm. Temperature was roughly 30 degrees. Took a while to organise a cab to our hotel. Had to mentally adjust to the driver being on the left hand side.

Checked in the Hampton Inn around 9pm. Very friendly service. Went down to get a few things for dinner. Grace and her sister got very excited about seeing American snacks they'd been missing in NZ.
