My name is Peter Sharp. I have just graduated Yoobee School of Design with a Diploma of Web Development.
I also have a Bachelor of Design from CPIT with majors in animation and illustration.

I really enjoy the problem solving challenges web brings both in UX and in software architecture. I also love learning new workflows and technologies. However, I still dabble in animation and illustration and hope to marry these interests with web in the future.

Send me a message; </br>I'd love to hear from you.
